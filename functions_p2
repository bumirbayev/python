# Functions

def hello(name):
    greet = "Hi! " + name
    print(greet)
    print("asdsadasd")
    return 50

hello("Jonathan")

# we could define in console, but it will take a long time. So we do "predefine"
# there are side effects of functions if we declare some variable = hello("Jonathan"), it will return 50, not Hi!, Jonathan else
